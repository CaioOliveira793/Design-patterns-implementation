# Design patterns inplementations

This project aims to show implementations of the GoF design patterns in the JavaScript language.
***

## What are Design Patterns

They are general solutions to recurring problems during software development. It is a high-level definition of how a common problem can be solved.

GoF design patterns are grouped into three different types: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

***

## Creational

Deals with the construction of the object.

- [Abstract Factory](creational/abstract-factory.js)
- [Builder](creational/builder.js)
- [Factory Method](creational/factory.js)
- [Prototype](creational/prototype.js)
- [Singleton](creational/singleton.js)

***

## Structural

Responsible for the relationship between objects and how they interact with each other to form larger and more complex objects.

- [Adapter](structural/adapter.js)
- [Bridge](structural/bridge.js)
- [Composite](structural/composite.js)
- [Decorator](structural/decorator.js)
- [Facade](structural/facade.js)
- [Flyweight](structural/flyweight.js)
- [Proxy](structural/proxy.js)

***

## Behavioral

They are focused on object communication, their responsibilities and algorithms.

- [Chain of Responsibility](behavioral/chainOfResponsibility.js)
- [Command](behavioral/command.js)
- [Interpreter](behavioral/interpreter.js)
- [Iterator](behavioral/iterator.js)
- [Mediator](behavioral/mediator.js)
- [Memento](behavioral/memento.js)
- [Observer](behavioral/observer.js)
- [State](behavioral/state.js)
- [Strategy](behavioral/strategy.js)
- [Template Method](behavioral/templateMethod.js)
- [Visitor](behavioral/visitor.js)
